Evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script ...
The result will be boolean "True or false "

# Operatores :
* *==*  is equal to ----> comperse 2 values to check if they are the same
* *===*  is strict equal to ----> comperse 2 values to check if both *Data type* and *Value* are the same 
* *!=*  is not equal to  ----> comperse 2 values to check if they are *not* the same
* *!==*    is strict Not equal to ----> comperse 2 values to check if both *Data type* and *Value* are *not* the same 
* *>*   is greater than  ----> chech if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right .
* *<*  is less than ---->  chech if the number on the left is less than the number on the right .
* *>=*  is greater than or equal ---->  chech if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right .
* *<=*  is less than or equal ----> chech if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right .

# Logical Operatores :
Allow u to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

* *&&*  both must be true to have true result 
* *||* one true give me true result
* *!* return the result to the opposite.between two single boolean value. 

# Loop 
 ### For loop :
to run the code specific number of times .

### While loop :
when u don't know how many times the code will run.

### Do While loop :
it will always run the statments inside the curly braces at least ones even it's false .
