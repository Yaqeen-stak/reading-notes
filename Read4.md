# Process and Design
when you decide to design a web site you have to know that many audience can access to and you have to target you audience.
Also, you have to make your web site useful so people visit it always .
**Then** You can start to organize the
information into sections or pages and make **Site Map**
**Make a wireframe**
wireframe is : a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site.
You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
then we have to write the code using HTML or CSS or JS .
