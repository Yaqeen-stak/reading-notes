# Design web pages with CSS 
### Color :
Imagine your pages without colors !!
Thats not acceptable at all.
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
 You can specify any color in CSS by one of the following :
* rgb values 
* hex Codes
* Color names
**Also** you can change the background color by one of the previous ways .
*Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue*
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
(Low , medium  and high contrast)
*CSS* allows you to control the opacity of colores and its between 0.1 and 1.0 .
*CSS3* introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using 
* hue
* saturation
* lightness value
