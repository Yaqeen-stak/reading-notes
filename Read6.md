# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
HTML,CSS and JS can't be separated
You have to know that :
* **HTML** : CONTENT LAYER
* **CSS** : PRESENTATION LAYER 
* **JS** : BEHAVIOR LAYER 

#### You should link the CSS and JS files in to HTML index .

## How can i run the JS?
Firt you should create a file with (.JS extension), so u can write the script
When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script.
 **JAVASCRIPT will not change the html of the page coz, JS workes with the model of the web page that the browser has created.**

### What is the statement?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 

***Note***
Use comment to help you (/*.....*/)
### Whate is the variables?

It's a space in memory  that store data of any type (numerical,string or boolean).
We can declared the varible by : *Var* any thing= ;

*BOOLEAN DATA TYPE* 
Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false. 
*SO* we can use If-esle statment.


Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then change what is stored in the variable later in the same script.
