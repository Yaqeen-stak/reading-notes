# Version control system 
* Allows you to return back to the previous versions of your project (you can edit or remove any)
* Gives you the history of files versions
* You can track all files versions and histories you have
* It allows many devolopers to work in the same code 
**But** what will happed if the VCS goes down ?
Here, we should know that there's DVCS which allows for multiple mirrored repositories,
 programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project,
 which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.



# Git 

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of **snapshots**.
 Each time you save a changed version of your project ***called commit*** Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
 If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

**Note that**  Gis is a local Operations, that means Git is already in your machine and no one can access on .
_Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged._

### Local Repository Structure
The local Git repository has three components:

* Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
* Index: The area used for staging
* Head: Points to the most recent commit

##### You shoid know that **head** is the pointter in git that tell you where you are .


# GitHub 
Github is a remote Operations ,it's VCS and you can calibrate it.
We can clone the repository to git by make acopy of it and download zip >
We can connect it to the github using **ACP** 
* add
* commit 
* push
